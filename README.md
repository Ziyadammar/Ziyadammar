ModelBuildingProject
Introduction
I made this project as apart of training machine learning in AI approach club. I chose a Dataset that represents the survived passengers from a ship crash.

Objective
This project aimed to: • See the factors that will enhance the model training. • show the difference among many ML algorithms. • discover which algorithm is more accurate.


  About Dataset
This dataset contains financial information for the top 500 companies in India, including their market capitalization and quarterly sales. The data is categorized based on market cap and sales quartiles, allowing for detailed analysis and comparison. This dataset can be used to identify trends, patterns, and key metrics that are crucial for understanding the competitive landscape in the Indian market.
Steps
Importing Libraries
Access to csv file in my drive files
Read the Dataset and check the head
DATA Cleaning
check information
data labeling
find correlation matrix
splitting the data to training and testing data
training the model.
evaluate the model performance
improve the performance
show the accuracy for each training algorithm
use many algorithms:
logistic regression
K-NN
SVM
Random Forest
Decision Tree
Conclusion
This project is an simple application of what I have learned about ML fundamentals. For each step within the project implementation, I support the codes with comments and description.

I am glad to receive any comments or notes.
